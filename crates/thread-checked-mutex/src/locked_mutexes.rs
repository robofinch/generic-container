        // does not call `access_locked_mutexes`, and does not
        // return anything that borrows/references the provided
        // `&mut Inner` reference. Therefore, we are not being

        // some other reference to the pointee of `locked_mutexes`
        // is live. That is, aliasing is satisfied at the start of
        // this supposed-to-be-unique borrow. Additionally, this
        // borrow ends at the end of this function (and cannot
        // somehow be extended by the return value). Since `f` does
        // not call `access_locked_mutexes`, which is the only way
        // to get another pointer to `locked_mutexes`â€™ pointee, the
        // reference remains unique in the remainder of this
